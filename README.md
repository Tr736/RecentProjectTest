# Marshmallow iOS Task 📱

Welcome to the Marshmallow iOS task! 👋 We'd now like to see an example of how you build apps.

## What we'd like you to do 🛠

Your task is to create an iOS app that provides a brief overview of SpaceX's rockets. 🚀 🛰

Please build an iOS app that meets the following requirements:

- Fetch a list of _rockets_ from the SpaceX API (more details below).
- Show the _rockets_ in a scrollable list.
- When tapping on a rocket, show a detail screen containing more information about the rocket.

We advise spending no longer than 2-4 hours on this task. It doesn't need to be perfect – we're more interested to see how you approach the task and what you prioritise.

If there's something you'd like to do but feel like you don't have enough time, feel free to add a list of things you would like to do next in the notes section below.

## Where do I find these rockets you speak of? 🚀

Please refer to the [SpaceX's open API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs) for this task. The `/rockets` endpoint should provide the necessary data.

## What should the UI look like? 🎨

There are no designs provided for this task – you have complete freedom over what the UI looks like so feel free to get creative. We understand you're not a designer, but we'd love to see what you think a good app looks like.

You are also encouraged to add any nice touches you feel showcase your abilities. However, the most important thing is that your code works, it is well structured, and meets the requirements outlined above.

## What should I use to build the app? 🧰

**What Xcode and iOS version should I use?**

- Xcode 12.4 or higher
- iOS 14

**Can I use SwiftUI?**

Although we're excited to use SwiftUI in future iOS versions of the Marshmallow app, we're currently using UIKit at Marshmallow. Please ensure the majority of your app is written using UIKit so we can better assess your understanding of UIKit itself.

**Can I use 3rd party libraries?**

You are free to use 3rd party libraries in your app. However, please explain *why* you decided to make use of any libraries in the notes section below.

We're looking to assess your understanding of iOS itself rather than open source libraries so please consider that in your decision making. However, we do understand that using some libraries could allow you to allocate your time more effectively to show off your skills in other areas.

## How we will evaluate your code 🔍

Please note that this task isn't about writing the perfect app, but will be used as a starting point for the technical interview. When we evaluate your code we will consider:

- Code organisation
- Quality
- Readability
- Style
- UI/UX design
- Tests
- Anything that shows you've gone above and beyond ✨

## Questions 🙋

Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions. It's better to ask for clarification up front if you're unsure of anything.

## Notes 📝

More time was spent on the Data side of the task rather than the UI. (In fact hardly anytime was spent on the UI thus it admittedly looks like pants.) 
I deemed data consumption and tests were relatively important than the UI for this particular test.
If you want to see evidence of my UI work please refer to the Triller || IBD Care app on the app store.

I wanted to demonstrate the use of protocols and how they can help avoid reliance on 3rd party frameworks, which I feel is super important when working in a modularised code base. And a really neat API class that makes it super easy to consume REST/JSON Data

This project took me 7 hours to write in all. This is because I believe if the foundations of a project are strong then anything that comes after will be nicer to work work. Thus good architecture from the get-go on any project is the most important part of any greenfield project.
